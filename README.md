This repository holds a self-contained scientific publication. It contains:

* HTML, javascript, CSS, fonts, and images (`index.html`, and the `javascript`, `stylesheets`, `fonts`, and `images` directories)
* A (limited) PDF version of the publication; note that this does not include animated/interactive figures.
* Code which implements part of the puzzle (in the `code` directory). You can run and modify this code to explore the apparent paradox.
